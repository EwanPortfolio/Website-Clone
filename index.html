            <p2>
                A new trailer has been released for the Pokémon Scarlet/Violet expansion, "The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero". Not much new information is given, however we do see Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti natively in-game.

                The first part, The Teal Mask introduces us to two trainers Carmine and Kieran in the new region of Kitakami. There is a "Festival of Masks" going on. The second part, The Indigo Disk, sees you visit Blueberry Academy, which appears to feature a large battle arena known as a "Terarium".

        <h1>New trailer hints at mysterious Pokemon from legends</h1>
        <p>
            A new trailer has been released for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet. For the most part it recaps things we've already seen to the tune of Ed Sheeran's "Celestial" (which is part of the soundtrack to the game), but near the end some brief shots of new Pokémon are seen. They bear a resemblance to Donphan, and according to the press release are known as "Great Tusk" and "Iron Treads".

            The two Pokémon are exclusive to Scarlet & Violet respectively, and are part of the "Scarlet Book" / "Violet Book" which are ancient tomes written about an expedition in the past.

            Following on from yesterday's addition to Pokémon GO, today a new trailer was released which confirms the Pokémon to be Gimmighoul. It is Ghost type and has two forms - Roaming Form, which is the one appearing in GO - and Chest Form, where it tries to get people to give it coins

        <p2>
            The Pokémon GO website also added an update, confirming that linking Scarlet/Violet with GO will allow catching the Roaming Form in GO, which can then be transferred (via HOME) to SV.
