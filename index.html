            <h2>New trailer hints at mysterious Pokemon from legends</h2>
            <h3>Pok√©mon Scarlet & Violet ‚Äî 08 November, 2022</h3>
            <p>A new trailer has been released for Pok√©mon Scarlet & Violet. For the most part it recaps things we've already seen to the tune of Ed Sheeran's "Celestial" (which is part of the soundtrack to the game), but near the end some brief shots of new Pok√©mon are seen. They bear a resemblance to Donphan, and according to the press release are known as "Great Tusk" and "Iron Treads".</p>
            <iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZWFiD5-hhFU" title="The Newest Chapters in the Pok√©mon Series üìî | Pok√©mon Scarlet and Pok√©mon Violet" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>The two Pok√©mon are exclusive to Scarlet & Violet respectively, and are part of the "Scarlet Book" / "Violet Book" which are ancient tomes written about an expedition in the past.</p>

            <h2>New Pok√©mon Gimmighoul revealed</h2>
            <h3>Pok√©mon Scarlet & Violet ‚Äî 06 November, 2022</h3>
            <P>Following on from yesterday's addition to Pok√©mon GO, today a new trailer was released which confirms the Pok√©mon to be Gimmighoul. It is Ghost type and has two forms - Roaming Form, which is the one appearing in GO - and Chest Form, where it tries to get people to give it coins.</P>
            <iframe width="800" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7wznn9FEH88" title="[UK] Where are these mysterious coins coming from? ü§î | Pok√©mon Scarlet and Pok√©mon Violet" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>The Pok√©mon GO website also added an update, confirming that linking Scarlet/Violet with GO will allow catching the Roaming Form in GO, which can then be transferred (via HOME) to SV.</p>

            <h2>New coin Pok√©mon released via Pok√©mon GO</h2>
            <h3>Pok√©mon Scarlet & Violet ‚Äî 05 November, 2022</h3>
            <img class="wrap-left" src="images/coin-pokemon.jpg" alt="coin-pokemon" width="219" height="232">
            <p>A new "Pok√©mon" has surfaced, following Dratini Community Day in Pok√©mon GO (which runs from 2-5pm on Saturday 5th). Yesterday its model was found in GO data and leaked by PokeMiners on Twitter.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 5pm, this creature begins following the player around the map, however, it is not catchable (and may not be a real Pok√©mon, in the vein of Zygarde cells). Several Pok√©Stops turn gold and many items can be acquired from them, including a "?????? Coin" which is apparently from the Paldea region.
            </p>
            <p>   
                UPDATE: a new website chest.pokemon.com was unveiled by the Pok√©mon Twitter account. It has a treasure chest which updates periodically. As I discovered, it's set to update at specific intervals, concluding at 24 hours and 999 coins (1pm GMT/6am PT), with something else happening an hour later at 2pm GMT/7am PT - possibly a new trailer!
